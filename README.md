- Centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs
- Scheduled execution via EventBridge and SSM Agent
- Secure IAM configuration (least privilege)
- Containerized architecture (Docker)
- Full CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- End-to-end testing flow

> Final README with full architecture diagram and setup instructions will follow once the core features are implemented.
